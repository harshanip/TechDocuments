Recently I wanted to create a web server , that sends simple response to rest call it gets. Using python we can create a web server withing few minutes.

 

These are the steps to install python and related packages in Ubuntu

 

    Install python

 

    sudo apt-get install python

 

    Install Easy Install for python.( Easy Install is a python module (easy_install) bundled with setuptools that lets you automatically download, build, install, and manage Python packages.)

 

    wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    sudo python ez_setup.py

 

    Install web.py . (web.py is a web framework for Python )

 

    sudo easy_install web.py

 

 

Copy below code to a file with .py extension and run it.

 

 
#!/usr/bin/env python  
import web  
  
  
urls = (  
    '/', 'successfull_delivery',  
)  
  
  
app = web.application(urls, globals())  
  
  
class successfull_delivery:          
    def POST(self):  
        output = 'POST';  
        print web.data()  
        return output   
                
    def GET(self):  
        output = 'GET';  
        print web.data()  
        return output  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    app.run()  


 

Change the file to executable

 

    chmod 777 <FileName>

 

 

To run server in specific port

    ./<filename> <port>
